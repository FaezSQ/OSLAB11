# Lab11 Linux Hardening
## MANUAL SUMMARY

Linux Hardening Techniques (LHT) involve implementing measures such as disabling unnecessary services and applications, keeping the system up-to-date with security patches, configuring firewalls to control network traffic, implementing strong password policies, configuring file system permissions to restrict access to sensitive files and directories, and user management best practices. There are also several Linux Hardening Tools available, including commands for configuring firewalls and automatic updates, as well as tools for implementing password policies, file system permissions, and user management.

Security auditing tools like Lynis and OpenSCAP can help automate the process of identifying and eliminating security risks. Lynis is a security auditing tool that performs system and application security audits, vulnerability scanning, and configuration hardening. OpenSCAP is a framework for system automation and compliance management, providing a standardized approach for automating security controls and compliance checks. Both tools have their strengths and weaknesses, with Lynis being easy to use but potentially generating false positives or false negatives, and OpenSCAP requiring a thorough understanding of compliance policies and security standards. There are alternative tools available, including JShielder, Nessus, CIS-CAT, and AIDE.

## TOOLS

### 1)Lynis:
Lynis is an open-source security auditing tool specifically designed for Linux and Unix-based systems. Its main purpose is to perform comprehensive system and application security audits, vulnerability scanning, and configuration hardening. Lynis scans the system and provides an audit report that includes a security score and identifies potential security risks.
To effectively use Lynis, you can simply run the command "sudo lynis audit system" in the terminal, and it will start scanning the system. After the scan is completed, Lynis generates an audit report that highlights the security score and lists potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that need attention. It also provides suggestions and recommendations for improving the system's security posture.

One potential shortcoming of Lynis is that it requires administrative privileges to run, as it needs to access system files and configurations. Additionally, like any security auditing tool, Lynis may generate false positives or false negatives in the audit report. It is important for administrators to carefully review the findings and validate them in their specific environment.

Alternative tools to Lynis include JShielder, which focuses on system hardening and security best practices, OpenVAS, which provides vulnerability scanning and management capabilities, and AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment), which is a host-based intrusion detection system.

### 2)OpenSCAP:
OpenSCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) is an open-source framework that aims to automate system automation and compliance management. It provides a standardized approach for automating security controls, vulnerability management, and compliance checks across Linux and Unix-based systems. OpenSCAP includes a set of security policies and guidelines that can be used to assess and validate system compliance.
To effectively use OpenSCAP, administrators can leverage pre-defined security policies included with the tool or create custom policies tailored to their specific requirements. OpenSCAP can scan the system against these policies and provide reports on the system's compliance status. It also offers remediation capabilities to help address any identified vulnerabilities or non-compliant configurations.

One potential shortcoming of OpenSCAP is that it requires a thorough understanding of compliance policies and security standards to effectively configure and use it. Administrators need to have knowledge of the relevant security controls and requirements specific to their industry or organization.

Alternatives to OpenSCAP include Lynis, which focuses more on auditing and hardening configurations, Nessus, a widely used vulnerability scanning tool, and CIS-CAT, which provides configuration assessment based on the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks.

### 3)JShielder:
JShielder is a security tool designed specifically for Linux systems to automate and simplify the process of hardening and securing the system. It provides a collection of security scripts and configurations that can be easily applied to enhance the security posture of the Linux system.
To effectively use JShielder, you can download and install it on your Linux system. Once installed, JShielder offers a range of pre-configured security settings and hardening options that can be easily applied to the system. These include securing network services, configuring firewall rules, enabling system monitoring, setting up secure SSH configurations, and more.

One potential shortcoming of JShielder is that it may not cover all security aspects or configurations specific to every Linux distribution or environment. Administrators may need to review and customize the applied settings based on their specific requirements and the Linux distribution being used.

Alternative tools to JShielder include Bastille Linux, a security hardening automation tool, and OSSEC, an open-source host-based intrusion detection system. Administrators can explore these alternatives to find the tool that best fits their security needs and requirements.
